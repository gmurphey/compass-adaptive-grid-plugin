# Compass Adaptive Grid Plugin

An adaptive grid Compass plugin heavily inspired by Matt Sanders' [compass-960-plugin](http://raw.github.com/nextmat/compass-960-plugin).

## Installation

    gem install compass-adaptive-grid-plugin

## Putting it to Use

    compass create -r adaptive-grid my_project --using adaptive-grid

Then you can edit your `scss` files as usual. A Compass reset is included with the base styles automatically.
